# game of life
 Conway's Game of Life written in Python.

 I originally created this project in SkillStruck during class.
 To avoid limitations of SkillStruck,
 I transfered this code to my personal computer to continue it. 

 This version of the Game of Life has:
 - [x] Control of simulation/tick speed
 - [x] Playing the simulation
 - [x] Stepping the generation forward one by one
 - [ ] Tooltips for cells
 - [ ] Generation/population counter
 - [ ] Complex mode (displays specific cell statuses)
 - [ ] Undoing generations (history saves 50 generations back!)
 - [ ] Rainbow cheat code (for fun!)
